Stable release
--------------

To install quickCI, run this command in your terminal (**Python>=3.6 only**):

    $ pip install quickci

This is the preferred method to install quickCI, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
